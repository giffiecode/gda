this is an implementation of discrete gda, continuous gda, and variable rate gda in R 

you can compare the models under any generated market conditions. you can twist model parameters to further compare.

the trade-off is control over emission schedule vs premium capturing during price surge, which are orthogonal to each other. 

if you are optimizing for control over emission schedule: continous gda, variable rate gda, discrete gda 

vice versa
